## Description

This project was built utilizing a MongoDB database, and Express.js routing. It creates the application's first CRUD API routes, which allow users to be created, searched for, updated, and removed. Users may also share their views, reply to the thoughts of their friends, establish a friend list, and then erase their thoughts, responses, friends, and themselves as users. Although this application is still in its early stages, the MongoDB database and API middleware routing are essential initial steps in learning about the capabilities of MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM.
